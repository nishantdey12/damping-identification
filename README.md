# damping-identification
The problem statement:
Finding the value of damping factor from the graph of dynamic amplification factor on the y axis and W/Wn on the x axis.

The problem is solved using CNN. The model is developed by continuous trial and error of accuracy and other parameter.
The best mse(mean squared error) obtained so far is 0.0109. 
It is small but not sufficient for this application. 

The model needs further improvement for practical applications.
